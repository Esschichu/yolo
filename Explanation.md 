# Project Title
IP 2:Creating a Basic Microservice

## Getting Started
-Install node: 'npm install'
-Install mongodb locally and start the mongodb service with `sudo service mongod start`
-Navigate to client folder and install dependencies then start the service by 'node server'/'npm start' (same applies for backend)

##Instructions
Create a Dockerfile for both frontend and backend that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image as indicated in the files.

Dockerfile:
#Define the base image in our case alphine which offers small size image and vulnerabilities
FROM node:12-alpine
#define the working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
#copy package.json to working directory
COPY package*.json /
#install dependancies
RUN npm install
#copy the packages to the working directory
COPY . .
#RUN chmod +x /usr/src/app/npm start
#Expose port 3000 and port 5000 (for both frontend and backend)
EXPOSE 3000
#DEfine entry point
CMD ["npm", "start"]

Docker-compose file:
A docker-compose.yml file is used to define and configure the services that make up an application in Docker. 
It allows you to define multiple services, specify their dependencies, and configure their settings, such as the environment variables, volumes, and ports.
The services availble are Client,backend and mongo each defined by image name,container_name and are linked together by my_network.
The ports are clearly defined as well as the mongodb credentials set in the environment parameter.
To build up the images, use;
'docker-compose up' 
 
 To push the images to docker hub:
 Tag each image first i.e: docker tag my-backend-image achieng/my-backend-image
                           docker tag my-frontend-image achieng/my-frontend-image

the push the images:
                            docker push achieng/my-backend-image
                            docker push achieng/my-frontend-image

This is the link to docker hub:
                           https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/achieng/my-frontend-image
                           https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/achieng/my-backend-image
